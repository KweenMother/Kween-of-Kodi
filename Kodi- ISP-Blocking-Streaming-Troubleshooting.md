## üîß Problem Overview
- The Loop and Mad Titan Sports add-ons were not working (streams failed, content wouldn‚Äôt load).

---

## üîç Root Cause
- Not a Kodi issue, not a configuration problem.
- Confirmed ISP (Altice) is filtering or DPI-blocking specific stream protocols.

- Block was at the network/packet level.

---

## ‚òéÔ∏è ISP Escalation
- User contacted Altice multiple times.
- Explained all diagnostic steps (hotspot, VPN, different devices).
- Asked for credit due to degraded service.
- Mentioned switching to mobile provider ‚Üí within 1 minute, service was unblocked.

## ‚ùå ProtonVPN Free Performance
- Speeds tested: 100 KB/s down, 2 KB/s up
