# 🚀 "THE INTERNET I WAS OWED" — My Victory Over Optimum’s Throttling
### 📅 Date: June 30, 2025  
### ⚔️ Hero: *Kween*  
### 🏴‍☠️ Villain: *Optimum (Altice) ISP*  

---

## 🔍 The Backstory
After enduring:
- ❌ Constant Kodi, Real-Debrid, The Loop, Mad Titan & Daddylive stream failures (`ConnectionResetError 10054`)  
- ❌ 501 errors from Real-Debrid's CDN  
- ❌ Optimum repeatedly claiming, *“It’s your device, not us”*

I proved them wrong.

> **The moment I connected to a mobile hotspot — everything worked.**  
> That was the beginning of the end for ISP gaslighting.

---

## 💥 The Winning Tactics

### 🧨 1. The Nuclear Option
- Powered up **Windscribe VPN** on my PC  
- Shared the connection via **Windows Mobile Hotspot** to my Xbox  
- Kodi Add-ons and Real-Debrid instantly worked  
- ✅ `ConnectionResetError` gone  
- ✅ Streams loaded in seconds  
- ✅ Real-Debrid 501 errors *obliterated*

### 🧠 2. Psychological Warfare
- Contacted Optimum multiple times:
  - Hotspot test: passed
  - VPN test: passed
  - Multiple devices and networks: passed
- Said: “You’re blocking this traffic. I’m not paying full price for broken internet.”
- Dropped the magic line:  
  > *“I'll switch to my cell provider permanently.”*

> **Less than 60 seconds later:**  
> Streams came back. Speed doubled. Throttling *silently lifted.*

### 🛡️ 3. Permanent Shields Activated
- ✅ **DNS override** → Cloudflare `1.1.1.1` (bypassed ISP DNS injection)  
- ✅ **VPN tunnel backup** → always ready if throttling returns  
- ✅ Saved **Kodi logs, IP evidence, and ISP call log** for potential FCC complaint

## 🛠️ Technical Appendix

### Devices & Tools
- **Device:** Xbox One S  
- **Kodi Version:** 21.2 (Omega)  
- **Add-ons:** FENtastic, Fen Light, The Loop, Mad Titan Sports, Daddylive, Trakt, Real-Debrid

## 🔧 Problem Overview
- The Loop, Mad Titan Sports, & Daddylive add-ons were not working (streams failed, content wouldn’t load).
- Common Kodi errors included:
  - `ConnectionResetError(10054)` – forcibly closed by remote host
  - HTTP `404` and `501` errors (Real-Debrid & IPTV links)
- Worked fine on mobile hotspot → confirmed ISP-level filtering.

---

## 🔍 Root Cause
- Not a Kodi issue, not a configuration problem.
- Confirmed ISP (Optimum) is filtering or DPI-blocking specific stream protocols.
- DNS override attempts failed.
- Block was at the network/packet level.

---

## ☎️ ISP Escalation
- Contacted Optimum 3 times.
- Explained all diagnostic steps (hotspot, VPN, different devices, different networks).
- Asked for credit due to degraded service.
- Mentioned switching to mobile provider → within 1 minute, service was unblocked.

## 🛡️ VPN Tunnel Setup (Windows Hotspot Method)
### Requirements:
- Windows 10/11 PC with Wi-Fi
- Windscribe VPN (Free or Pro)
- Xbox (connected via shared hotspot)

### Steps Taken:
1. Connected Windscribe VPN on PC  
2. Enabled Mobile Hotspot  
3. Shared Windscribe adapter through ICS in Control Panel  
4. Connected Xbox to hotspot  
5. Verified VPN IP using whatismyip.com  
6. Kodi streams + Real-Debrid now working flawlessly

---

## 📲 iPhone 16 (Personal Hotspot Method)
### Requirements:
- iPhone 16 or any generation with Wi-Fi/Hotspot
- Any mobile device with Wi-Fi/Hotspot

### Steps Taken:
1. Enabled Personal Hotspot on iPhone 16  
2. Connected Xbox to iPhone 16 hotspot  
3. Kodi streams + Real-Debrid now working impeccably

## 😐 ProtonVPN Free Performance
- Speeds tested: 100 KB/s down, 2 KB/s up  
- Almost unusable for streaming but **did** work  
- Not Real-Debrid friendly  
- Free tier locked to 3 overloaded servers

---

## ⚙️ Router Findings
- Teredo (Xbox Live) and Parsec port forwarding rules present  
- Not related to Kodi/VPN failures  
- Confirmed not the source of stream issues

---

## ✅ Final Results
- Streams work reliably via VPN tunnel & iPhone 16 Personal Hotspot  
- ISP (Optimum) block was silently lifted after escalation  
- Real-Debrid errors (501) resolved  
- ConnectionResetError(10054) resolved  
- Kodi add-ons stable now

---

## 🔮 Next Missions
- [ ] Set up **VPN router** to auto-tunnel Xbox + all devices  
- [ ] Submit **formal complaint to FCC/FTC** (documented throttling)  
- [ ] Publish full **GitHub guide or Reddit how-to** to help others  
- [ ] Share template for ISP escalation (because *they will lie*)

---

## 💾 Notes for Future Use
- Keep VPN & iPhone 16 hotspot as backup in case ISP filtering returns  
- Consider dedicated VPN router for plug-and-play tunneling  
- Documented configuration for future troubleshooting  
- File complaint against ISP if filtering does return
